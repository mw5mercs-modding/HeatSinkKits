# HeatSinkKits - A Mechwarrior 5 Mercs Mod

This mod introduces Heat Sink Kits which are installed in the YAML Engine Double Heatsink slot. 
Different heat sink types cannot be mixed anymore and require a compatible heat sink kit. So in order to equip double heat sinks
one first needs to install a double heat sink kit, the same for Clan or Compact Heat Sinks.

It also introduces radical heat sink kits which have a fail chance when overheating, causing internal damage to the CT.

## New Equipments
- Double Heat Sink Kit (replaces YAML's Engine Double Heat Sinks)
- Compact Heat Sink Kit
- Clan Double Heat Sink Kit
- Prototype Heat Sink Kit
- Prototype Double Heat Sink - 0.12 cooling, 1 ton, 1 slot, 3% less weapon heat, can explode
- Radical DHS Kit which dissipates heat quickly when active but also has a fail chance.
- Radical Proto DHS Kit which dissipates heat quickly when active but also has a fail chance.
