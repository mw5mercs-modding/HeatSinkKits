# HeatSinkKits - A Mechwarrior 5 Mercs Mod

This mod introduces Heat Sink Kits which are installed in the YAML Engine Double Heatsink slot. 
Different heat sink types cannot be mixed anymore and require a compatible heat sink kit. So in order to equip double heat sinks
one first needs to install a double heat sink kit, the same for Clan or Compact Heat Sinks.

## New Equipments
- Double Heat Sink Kit (replaces YAML's Engine Double Heat Sinks)
- Compact Heat Sink Kit
- Clan Double Heat Sink Kit

## Dependencies

HeatSinkKits depends on YetAnotherMechlab, YetAnotherWeapon and YetAnotherWeaponClan.

## Load Order

It is important to load HeatSinkKits with a higher priority than YetAnotherMechlab. The default load order is set accordingly.
